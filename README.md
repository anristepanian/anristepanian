## Hi there, I'm Anri ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science student at IU Internationale Hochschule from Armenia. My curiosity about analysis and understanding how things work is what led me to choose a career as a data scientist.<br><br>I'm passionate about programming and developing different types of applications that will make most of our routine tasks easier and help us to save one of the most important things we have - time. Learning languages â€‹â€‹is another passion of mine along with coding. Being able to surprise people by speaking their mother tongue is quite exciting!<br><br>I would like to have an opportunity to work in an environment where I would be able combine all my passions!<br>__Wennschon, dennschon!__
